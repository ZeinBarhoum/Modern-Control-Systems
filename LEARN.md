# Modern-Control-Systems
This repository contains the code and models I developed during my Modern Control Systems course at ITMO University.

The cource was devided into 3 parts which are:
1. Adaptive and Robust control: in this part, 4 types of controllers were implemented which are:
  - Adaptive controller
  - Robust controller (with high gain feedback)
  - Adaptive controller with robust modification (Adaptive-Robust controller)
  - Output feedback adaptive control using the augmented error approach
2. Optimal control: in this part, an LQR controller was implemented to optimize a specific objective.
3. Trajectory control: in this part, three algorithms for stabilizing the motion of a robot(dynamic system) on a specific path (2D and 3D) were implemented.

All lab works were implemented using MATLAB/Simulink and the reports for each lab are included in the respective directories.
